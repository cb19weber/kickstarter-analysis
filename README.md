# Some Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
### Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends for DU Data Module 1

Let's talk about crowd source funding! So you want to create a play, and you have in mind a vision to deliver something beautiful, thoughtful, and engaging. The outfits, the choreography, the scenes flowing from one dramatic portrayal to the next, the budget, the...wait. What? Yeah, the budget generate the same emotional response as the actual art. But it is crucial to making the vision a reality. Before all of the heart-felt applause and handing off of bouquets, some of those hearts and hands are going to need to donate some funds to get this thing off the ground.

It's an interesting paradigm that as much love and passion as people can have for the arts, not all endeavors to fund them are successful? Why do some efforts succeed and others fail? What can we learn from analyzing the outcomes of various attempts? And how might that analysis help us in future endeavors? Enter this analysis of kickstarter campaigns to shed some light on some of these questions. An analysis of almost four thousand kickstarter campaigns to fund various efforts around the globe reveal that musical theater fundraising efforts certainly can be successful. But a few key decisions along the way can help build an outline.

Fundraising campaigns involving theater in the United States have largely been successful three-quarters of the time they are launched. There is certainly an appetite and an appreciation among the populous for theater and plays that is demonstrated here.

Interestingly, something about late spring seems to stir the hearts of those who would pledge their hard-earned monies toward fundraising efforts. While the winter months don't show great success, funding campaigns launched around May or June seem to have the most success.

Plays specifically funded in the United States show some interesting trends. While having a vision for ornate backgrounds and stunning fashion can be initially attractive, analysis shows that most successful plays in the U.S. range within a fundraising goal of $1,500 to $5,000, with an about half of all fundraising efforts generating slightly under $3,200 per play. There seems to be a clear delineation between successful and failed campaigns related to overall capital goals. Whether consious or not, behavior of pledging seems to indicate an appreciation for plays that can produce on smaller budgets.

Putting it all together, hopefully you can use this analysis to make your dream play into a reality. For those that succeed, the thunderous applause will be waiting when that curtain finally drops on a job well done. It wasn't all for the actors and actresses, but also for the hard work in budget, playwrite, and design to create something truly compelling for all of us.
